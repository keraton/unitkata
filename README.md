## TDD Rules
* You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
* You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
* You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## TDD cycle
Red - Green - Refactor

## Bonus
Use java 8 Stream
